Inpatient Data Dictionary 
 
Welcome to the HES Inpatient Data Dictionary. If you have any feedback or suggestions about this

About the Inpatient Data Dictionary 
 
The Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database is made up of many data items relating to admitted 
patient care delivered by NHS hospitals in England. Many of these items form part of the national 
Commissioning Data Set (CDS), and are generated by the patient administration systems within each 
hospital. 
 
In addition to the CDS items, HES provides information that is derived from these. For example, the 
age of the patient is derived from their date of birth. These derivations assist in the production of 
aggregate summaries (tabulations), and also help ensure patient confidentiality. 
 
HES contains data from 1 April 1989. Over the years, there have been several changes in the 
specification and meaning of various data items. From April 2003, this data was available in a 
normalised form that makes interpretation easier. This has been achieved by modifying the values of 
certain items for previous years so that, where possible, they conform to contemporary standards. 
This issue of the Data Dictionary reflects the situation after normalisation.

Availability  
Description 
There are twenty-four fields (twelve before April 2007 and four prior to April 2002), oper_01 to 
oper_24, which contain information about a patient's operations.  
The field oper_01 contains the main (ie most resource intensive) procedure. The other fields 
contain secondary procedures.  
The codes are defined in the Tabular List of the Classification of Surgical Operations and 
Procedures. The current version is OPCS4. Procedure codes start with a letter and are 
followed by two or three digits.  
The third digit identifies variations on a main procedure code containing two digits. The third 
digit is preceded by a full stop in OPCS4, but this is not stored in the field. A single operation 
may contain more than one procedure. 
Value 
4an = Procedure code

Description 
This derived field provides the duration of an episode in days within the HES data year. It is 
derived from epistart (episode start date) and epiend (episode end date).  
For episodes that both start and finish in the data year, bedyear has the same value as epidur 
(episode duration). If the episode is unfinished, bedyear is calculated from epistart and the 
end of the data year.  
If epistart is before the beginning of the data year, bedyear is calculated from the start of the 
data year and epiend. If the record type is other maternity events (episode type 5 or 6), 
bedyear is null.

Description 
This field contains the number of the episode within the current spell. All spells start with an 
episode where epiorder is 01.  
Many spells finish with this episode, but if the patient moves to the care of another consultant, 
a new episode begins. Episode numbers increase by 1 for each new episode until the patient 
is discharged (this includes transfers to another NHS trust or primary care trust - ie the first 
episode in the new trust will have epiorder 01).  
If the same patient returns for a different spell in hospital, epiorder is again set to 01.  
Admissions are calculated by counting the number of times epiorder is 01. When studying 
long term care, remember that it is not unusual to transfer psychiatric patients from one 
hospital to another.

Class Episodes and spells 
Length and format 1n 
Availability  
Description 
This field tells you whether the episode had finished before the end of the HES data-year (ie 
whether the episode was still 'live' at midnight on 31 March).  
For example, if a patient was admitted on 25 March 2005 and was not discharged (or 
transferred to the care of another consultant) until 4 April 2005, there will be a record 
describing the unfinished episode (episode status = 1) in the 2004-05 data, and a separate 
record describing the finished episode (episode status = 3) in the 2005-06 data.  
Because hospital providers are advised not to include clinical data (diagnosis and operation 
codes) in unfinished records, these are normally excluded from analyses.  
Also, if unfinished episodes are included in time series analyses - where data for more than 
one year is involved - there is a danger of counting the same episode twice.

Field epiorder 
Class Period of care 
Length and format 2n 
Availability  
Description 
This field contains the number of the episode within the current spell.  
All spells start with an episode where epiorder is 01.  
Many spells finish with this episode, but if the patient moves to the care of another consultant, 
a new episode begins.  
Episode numbers increase by 1 for each new episode until the patient is discharged (this 
includes transfers to another NHS trust or primary care trust - ie the first episode in the new 
trust will have epiorder 01).  
If the same patient returns for a different spell in hospital, epiorder is again set to 01. 
Admissions are calculated by counting the number of times epiorder is 01.  
When studying long term care, remember that it is not unusual to transfer psychiatric patients 
from one hospital to another. 
Value 
2n = The number of the episode in the sequence of episodes from 01-87

HES field name Episode status 
Field epistat 
Class Period of care 
Length and format 1n 
Availability  
Description 
This field tells you whether the episode had finished before the end of the HES data-year (ie 
whether the episode was still 'live' at midnight on 31 March).  
For example, if a patient was admitted on 25 March 2005 and was not discharged (or 
transferred to the care of another consultant) until 4 April 2005, there will be a record 
describing the unfinished episode (episode status = 1) in the 2004-05 data, and a separate 
record describing the finished episode (episode status = 3) in the 2005-06 data.  
Because hospital providers are advised not to include clinical data (diagnosis and operation 
codes) in unfinished records, these are normally excluded from analyses.  
Also, if unfinished episodes are included in time series analyses - where data for more than 
one year is involved - there is a danger of counting the same episode twice.

several hospital providers, priority is given to the current hospital provider (code 1), regardless 
of whether the preceding admission was to the same hospital provider.  
This field replaces special (UK NHS specific) diagnosis codes commencing U69 (1 April 1989

intensive care but exceeding routine care 
3 = V292 - Neonate: intensive care which involved continuous skills supervision by nursing and 
medical staff for at least one hour or until death. Resuscitation carried out immediately after 
birth and completed within an hour or so does not constitute intensive care 
4 = V690 - Psychiatric: not previously known to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital or hospital 
unit 
5 = V691 - Psychiatric: previously admitted to a psychiatric hospital or hospital unit of the 
provider 
6 = V692 - Psychiatric: previously admitted to a psychiatric hospital or a hospital unit of another

V291 became U501 
V292 became U502 or U503 (U502 denoting a level of care higher than that previously 
denoted by V291 but falling short of the highest, for which U503 was used)

Class System 
Length and format 7n 
Availability  
Description 
This field contains a value, calculated to four decimal places, that combines administrative 
(coverage) grossing (the value contained in data item gross_a) and clinical grossing. Clinical 
grossing compensates for the under counting of diagnoses or operations that occurs where 
cases contain a not known diagnosis code.  
The diagnostic data in a predefined group is analysed to ascertain the proportion of records 
that do not have a valid primary diagnosis. This shortfall in diagnostic coding is used to 
calculate a compensating factor.  
The clinical factor is multiplied by the value in gross_a to produce the combined grossing 
factor, gross_b. The default value for this field is 1.0000. It is overwritten when clinical 
grossing is selected.
